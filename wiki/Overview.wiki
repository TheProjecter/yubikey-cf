#summary yubikey-cf an OTP Verification Pass

= Purpose =

This basic CFC is intended to provide an interface to the YubiCo YubiKey API for Multi Factor Authentication. 

At current, it very simply verifies an OTP against the web service.

In future releases I intend to add support for full request signing as well as testing against 3rd party auth servers to make it a more rounded package for YubiKey integration from ColdFusion (or CFML) applications.
